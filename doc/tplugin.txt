*tplugin.txt*       A simple plugin loader/runtimepath manager
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

This plugin helps users to avoid loading plugins on startup but only 
when they are actually needed. It also allows users to maintain their 
plugins in an alternative directory layout.

Usually, all plugins are installed under one root directory (see 
|vimfiles|). This makes it potentially cumbersome to install a plugin 
that is distributed as zip/tgz or is downloaded from a source code 
repository. It also makes it more difficult than necessary to 
temporarily use a plugin, e.g., for testing purposes.

tplugin allows users to install plugins in an alternative directory 
structure where each plugin (consequently referred to as "repo") is 
installed in a subdirectory. tplugin takes care of modifying 
'runtimepath' and of loading the vim script files as necessary.

Alternative directory layout:

    ROOT/
      repo1/
        after/
        autoload/
        doc/
        plugin/
      repo2/
        after/
        autoload/
        doc/
        plugin/
      ...

Repos can be enabled (i.e. added to 'runtimepath') either explicitly 
with the |:TPlugin| command or automatically by calling a command, 
function, or by requesting a filetype plugin/syntax/indent file defined 
in a repo -- i.e. tplugin also provides an autoload facility similar to 
the AsNeeded plugin (vimscript #915). See below for details.

The main purpose of this plugin was to facilitate the use of plugins 
that are downloaded from a VCS like git, svn etc. But it can also be 
used to handle plugins distributed as zip or tgz archives. For vimballs, 
you'll might have to use a non-standard vimball unpacker---like the one 
that can be found in the vimtlib repository.

You can have more than one root directory although it currently (as of 
version 0.2) could cause problems and is deprecated. 


Usage~
                                                    *tplugin-autoload*
With autoload:

    By default, tplugin has autoload enabled. With autoload, you can use 
    tplugin by (1) loading the macro in your |vimrc| file and then (2) 
    (optional step) setting non-standard root directories. The standard 
    root-directory is ~/vimfiles/repos (or ~/.vim/repos) and does not 
    have to be explicitely declared.

    Example: >
        
        runtime macros/tplugin.vim
        " Only necessary if you use a non-standard root directory
        TPluginRoot /home/x/src/repos

<   (3) Collect the autoload information by running the |:TPluginScan| 
    command. (4) Restart vim.

    The plugins will be loaded as soon as one of its functions or 
    commands is called for the first time.

    When using autoload, for every known ROOT (see |:TPluginRoot|), the 
    file ROOT/_tplugin.vim is loaded on startup. This file is created by 
    the |:TPluginScan| command and should not be edited by the user.

                            *tplugin-dependencies* *tplugin-metadata*
    When enabling a repository (ROOT/REPO), e.g., by calling |:TPlugin|, 
    the files ROOT/_tplugin_REPO.vim and ROOT/REPO/_tplugin.vim are 
    loaded. These files allows users (or plugin developers) to, e.g., 
    define dependencies (see |:TPluginBefore| and |:TPluginAfter|).


Without autoload:

    (1) Load the macro and (2) set non-standard root directories. In 
    addition, (3) load plugins as desired.

    Example: >

        runtime macros/tplugin.vim
        " Only necessary if you use a non-standard root directory
        TPluginRoot /home/x/src/repos
        " Load all plugins in repo1
        TPlugin repo1
        " Load only specified plugins from repo2
        TPlugin repo2 foo bar

<   It is advantageous to source the macro rather at the top of your 
    vimrc file before making any changes to the 'runtimepath'. If you 
    don't change the 'runtimepath', the position is of no importance.

    Then install your plugins/repos in the root directory. After 
    restarting vim, type :TPluginScan!

    Full example as it could be found in a |vimrc| file: >

        runtime macros/tplugin.vim
        TPluginRoot F:\repos
        TPlugin vim-surround
        let g:snippets_dir = 'X:\vimfiles\snippets,F:\repos\snipmate.vim\snippets'
        TPlugin snipmate.vim
        TPlugin! vimtlib 02tlib


CAVEAT: If you have a file after/plugin/foo.vim in you user vimfiles 
directory, this file will be loaded before any "managed" plugin "foo". 
You thus have to check in your after/plugin/foo.vim file if the plugin 
was already loaded.

Contrary to the default plugin behaviour, those managed plugins are 
loaded when the |VimEnter| event is triggered, i.e. after all plugins 
(incl. the after directory) and |gvimrc| was loaded. This approach 
provides for a better control of which plugins should be loaded. You can 
load a managed plugin immediately by adding a bang '!' to the |:TPlugin| 
command.

                                                    *tplugin-asneeded*
AsNeeded Users~

tplugin can serve as a drop-in replacement for the AsNeeded plugin. Add 
the following command to you |vimrc| file: >

    TPluginRoot ~/vimfiles/AsNeeded/*

Alternatively, move the files the AsNeeded subdirectory to 
REPOS/AsNeeded/plugin/.

Run |:TPluginScan| in order to create autoload definitions for commands 
and functions.

Contrary to the AsNeeded plugin, tplugin only supports autoload for 
|<Plug>| type of maps. Other autoload maps have to be defined by the 
user using the |TPluginMap()| function.

                                                    *g:tplugin_autoload*
g:tplugin_autoload             (default: 1)
    Enable autoloading. See |:TPluginScan|, |:TPluginCommand|, and 
    |:TPluginFunction|.
    Values:
      1 ... Enable autoload (default)
      2 ... Enable autoload and automatically run |:TPluginScan| 
            after updating tplugin.

                                                    *g:tplugin_autoload_exclude*
g:tplugin_autoload_exclude     (default: [])
    A list of repositories for which autoload is disabled when running 
    |:TPluginScan|.

                                                    *g:tplugin_helptags*
g:tplugin_helptags             (default: 1)
    If non-nil and a repo contains no helptags file, generate helptags 
    for the repository's doc subdirectory.
    
    See also |g:tplugin_scan|.

                                                    *g:tplugin_menu_prefix*
g:tplugin_menu_prefix          (default: '')
    If autoload is enabled and this variable is non-empty, build a 
    menu with available plugins.
    Menus are disabled by default because they are less useful 
    than one might think with autoload enabled.
    A good choice for this variable would be, e.g., 
    'Plugin.T&Plugin.'.
    NOTE: You have to re-run |:TPluginScan| after setting this 
    value.

                                                    *g:tplugin_scan*
g:tplugin_scan                 (default: 'cfpta')
    The default value for |:TPluginScan|. A set of identifiers 
    determining the information being collected:
       c ... commands
       f ... functions
       p ... <plug> maps
       t ... filetypes
       h ... helptags (always regenerate helptags, see also |g:tplugin_helptags|)
       a ... autoload
       all ... all of the above

                                                    *:TPlugin*
:TPlugin[!] REPOSITORY [PLUGINS ...]
    Register certain plugins for being sourced at |VimEnter| time.
    See |tplugin.txt| for details.
    
    With the optional '!', the plugin will be loaded immediately.
    In interactive use, i.e. once vim was loaded, plugins will be loaded 
    immediately anyway.
    
    IF REPOSITORY contains a slash or a backslash, it is considered the 
    path relative from the current root directory to the plugin directory. 
    This allows you to deal with repositories with a non-standard 
    directory layout. Otherwise it is assumed that the source files are 
    located in the "plugin" subdirectory.
    
    IF PLUGIN is "-", the REPOSITORY will be enabled but no plugin will be 
    loaded.

                                                    *:TPluginRoot*
:TPluginRoot DIRECTORY
    Define the root directory for the following |:TPlugin| commands.
    Read autoload information if available (see |g:tplugin_autoload| and 
    |:TPluginScan|).
    
    If DIRECTORY ends with "*", it doesn't refer to a directory hierarchy 
    à la vimfiles but to a single "flat" directory.
    
    Example: >
      " A collection of git repositories
      TPluginRoot ~/src/git_repos
      " A directory with experimental plugins
      TPluginRoot ~/vimfiles/experimental_plugins/*
<

                                                    *:TPluginScan*
:TPluginScan[!] [WHAT] [ROOT]
    Scan the current root directory for commands and functions. Save 
    autoload information in "ROOT/_tplugin.vim".
    
    Where WHAT is a set of letters determining the information being 
    collected. See |g:tplugin_scan| for details.
    
    With the optional '!', the autocommands are immediatly usable.
    
    Other than the AsNeeded plugin, tplugin doesn't support the creation 
    of autoload information for maps.
    
    If you collect repositories in one than more directory, I'd suggest to 
    create a special script.
    
    The source file may contain special markers that make :TPluginScan 
    include text in the _tplugin.vim file:
                                                        *@TPluginInclude*
    Blocks of non-empty lines are introduced with an @TPluginInclude tag: >
    
      " @TPluginInclude
      augroup Foo
           autocmd!
           autocmd Filetype foo call foo#Init()
      augroup END
    
<   Special lines are prefixed with @TPluginInclude: >
      
      " @TPluginInclude if !exists('g:foo') | let g:foo = 1 | endif
    
<   Example: >
      TPluginRoot dir1
      TPluginScan
      TPluginRoot dir2
      TPluginScan
<

                                                    *:TPluginBefore*
:TPluginBefore FILE_RX [GLOB_PATTERNS ...|@REPO]
    Load dependencies given as GLOB_PATTERNS (see |wildcards|) or as a 
    REPO's name before loading a file matching the |regexp| pattern 
    FILE_RX.
    
    The files matching FILE_PATTERNS are loaded after the repo's path is 
    added to the 'runtimepath'. You can thus use partial filenames as you 
    would use for the |:runtime| command.
    
    This command should be best put into ROOT/tplugin_REPO.vim files, 
    which are loaded when enabling a source repository.
    
    Example: >
      " Load master.vim before loading any plugin in a repo
      TPluginBefore plugin/.\{-}\.vim plugin/master.vim
<

                                                    *:TPluginAfter*
:TPluginAfter FILE_RX [GLOB_PATTERNS ...|@REPO]
    Load other plugins matching GLOB_PATTERNS (see |wildcards|) or as a 
    REPO's name after loading a file matching the |regexp| pattern 
    FILE_RX.
    See also |:TPluginBefore|.
    
    Example: >
      " Load auxiliary plugins after loading master.vim
      TPluginAfter plugin/master\.vim plugin/sub_*.vim
<

                                                    *TPluginMap()*
TPluginMap(map, repo, plugin, ?remap="")
    MAP is a map command and the map. REPO and PLUGIN are the same as for 
    the |:TPlugin| command.
    
    Examples: >
      " Map for <plug>Foo:
      call TPluginMap('map <plug>Foo', 'mylib', 'myplugin')
    
      " Load the plugin when pressing <f3> and remap the key to an appropriate 
      " command from the autoloaded plugin:
      call TPluginMap('map <f3>', 'mylib', 'myplugin', ':Foo<cr>')
<

                                                    *TPluginAutoload()*
TPluginAutoload(prefix, def)

                                                    *TPluginFunction()*
TPluginFunction(FUNCTION, REPOSITORY, [PLUGIN])
    Load a certain plugin on demand (aka autoload) when FUNCTION is called 
    for the first time.

                                                    *TPluginCommand()*
TPluginCommand(COMMAND, REPOSITORY, [PLUGIN])
    Load a certain plugin on demand (aka autoload) when COMMAND is called 
    for the first time. Then call the original command.
    
    For most plugins, |:TPluginScan| will generate the appropriate 
    TPluginCommand commands for you. For some plugins, you'll have to 
    define autocommands yourself in the |vimrc| file.
    
    Example: >
      TPluginCommand TSelectBuffer vimtlib tselectbuffer
