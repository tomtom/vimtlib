*tplugin.txt*       A simple plugin loader/runtimepath manager
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

With the distribution of vim plugins as git repositories, the usual 
directory layout has become somewhat disadvantagous. This script 
provides a way to load those plugins in an efficient manner. 

Raison d'être: Help users of the vimtlib repository 
(http://github.com/tomtom/vimtlib/) to pick the plugins they want to 
use. But it is usable for any plugin that is distributed as git or svn 
repository etc.

It also assumes that your local copies follow a certain directory 
layout:

    ROOT/
      repo1/
        after/
        autoload/
        doc/
        plugin/
      repo2/
        after/
        autoload/
        doc/
        plugin/
      ...

In order to use this plugin insert the following lines at the top of 
your |vimrc| file: >

    source WHEREVER/macros/tplugin.vim

If you have installed this script in your default user |vimfiles| 
directory, you could also use: >
    
    runtime macros/tplugin.vim

It is advantageous to source the macro rather at the top of your vimrc 
file before making any changes to the 'runtimepath'. If you don't change 
the 'runtimepath', the position is of no importance.

If the ROOT directory is not the subdirectory "repos" of the first 
directory in your 'runtimepath' (i.e. something like ~/vimfiles/repos), 
you also have to add the following command: >

    TPluginRoot ~/vimfiles/repos

Now, for each plugin repository you want to load, add a |:TPlugin| 
command. I.e. you have to enable every single repository (a.k.a. 
opt-in).

1.) Load all plugins in repository "repo1":

    TPlugin repo1

2.) Load certain plugins in repository "repo2" (this is relevant for 
comprehensive repositories like vimtlib although it would be better to 
split such repositories into specific ones):

    TPlugin repo2 foo bar

Full example: >

    runtime macros/tplugin.vim
    TPluginRoot F:\repos
    TPlugin vim-surround
    let g:snippets_dir = 'F:\repos\snipmate.vim\snippets'
    TPlugin snipmate.vim
    TPlugin vimtlib 02tlib viki trag checksyntax

CAVEAT: If you have a file after/plugin/foo.vim in you user vimfiles 
directory, this file will be loaded before any "managed" plugin "foo". 
You thus have to check in your after/plugin/foo.vim file if the plugin 
was already loaded.

Other than the default plugin behaviour, those managed plugins are 
loaded when the |VimEnter| event is triggered, i.e. after all plugins 
(incl. the after directory) and |gvimrc| was loaded. This approach 
provides for a better control of which plugins should be loaded. You can 
load a managed plugin immediately by adding a bang '!' to the |:TPlugin| 
command.

g:tplugin_helptags             (default: 1)
    If non-nil, optionally generate helptags for the repository's doc 
    subdirectory.

:TPlugin[!] REPOSITORY [PLUGINS ...]
    Register certain plugins for being sourced at |VimEnter| time.
    See |tplugin.txt| for details.
    With the optional '!', the plugin will be loaded immediately.
    In interactive use, i.e. once vim was loaded, plugins will be loaded 
    immediately anyway.

                                                    *:TPluginRoot*
:TPluginRoot DIRECTORY
    Define the root directory for the following |:TPlugin| commands.
