*localvariables.txt*	File local variables

                                                    *localvariables*
Description:
This plugin tries to mimic Emacs's file local variables feature. File local 
variables are kept in a section in the last g:localVariablesRange 
(default=30) lines of a file (this variable also defines the maximum number 
of file local variables). E.g., in this example >

    Local Variables:
    foo:1
    bar:"bla"
    End:

the variable b:foo will be set to "1" (which, in vim, equals 1), b:bar 
to "bla" after opening the file.

The beginning of the section is marked with g:localVariablesBegText 
(default="Local Variables:"), the end with g:localVariablesEndText 
(default="End:"). These markers can be surrounded by arbitrary prefix and 
suffix markers. These (optional) prefixes and suffixes must be consistent for 
the whole section. The prefix and suffix are defined by the end-marker. 
Example: >

    ### Local Variables: ###
    ### foo:1 ###
    ### bar:"bla" ###
    ### End: ###
 
                                                    *g:localVariablesDownCaseHyphenedNames*
                                                    *localvariables-hyphens*
If a variable name contains a hyphen ("-"), the variable name will be 
translated into a buffer local variable in camel case, i.e. "comment-start" 
becomes "b:commentStart". A hyphendized variable's scope is always "b". If 
g:localVariablesDownCaseHyphenedNames (default=1) is true, then the variable 
name will be downcased first for compatibility reasons -- as (emacs) lisp is 
case insensitive. I.e., "COMMENT-START" becomes "b:commentStart", too.

                                                    *g:localVariablesVimlet*
If g:localVariablesVimlet evaluates to true, then lines like: >

    vimlet: var1=val1 | var2=val2

are allowed too. These lines are simply evaluated (after doing some 
simple replacements). The variables are always made buffer local.

                                                    *localvariables-values*
A small note on value handling: For security reasons, all normal values 
(i.e., anything but |localvariables-special|) are put in quotes unless 
the value already matches "^\"[^\"]*\"$\\|^'[^']*'$".


                                                    *localvariables-transpose*
In order to be "compatible" with, e.g, Emacs's file local variables, it might be 
necessary to translate some variable names.

You can use also variables with the prefix "g:localVariableX" for 
translating variable names without scope definitions. Example: >

    let g:localVariableXtabWidth = "&tabstop"
    ---
    ### Local Variables: ###
    ### tab-width:4 ###
    ### End: ###

This would set the buffer-local option |tabstop| to 4. (Which could of course 
be achieved with a vim line, too.)

As an alternative, you can also define a function with the prefix 
"LocalVariableX" which will be called with the value as single argument.  
This provides a controlled way for executing commands when loading/editing 
a file. By defining a function "LocalVariableXmode", this can be used to 
reuse Emacs's mode annotations for files that don't match the usual file 
patterns. Example: >

    fun! LocalVariableXfoo(arg)
        if a:arg == "0"
            GoFoo
        elseif a:arg == "1"
            GoBar
        endif
    endfun
    ---
    ### Local Variables: ###
    ### foo:0 ###
    ### End: ###

This example would execute GoFoo or GoBar depending on the value of the file 
local variable foo.


                                                    *localvariables-definition*
A variable definition has the form (as regexp): >

	((scope char:)?(variable|special name)|hyphened name):value

If no scope character is given, the variable is buffer local ("b"-scope).

If the scope character is "&", |setlocal| will be used to set the variable.

                                                      *localvariables-special*
If the scope is ":", the variable name is interpreted as a special name:

                                                      *localvariables-execute*
- execute: The value of s:localVariablesAllowExec can't be changed by this 
  script. (The first 4 letters of "execute" are essential.)

                                                      *localvariables-events*
                                                      *LocalVariablesRegisterHook*
- On{event}: The value is registered for execution when the denoted 
  autocommand event occurs. You have to register LocalVariables for use with 
  this event by using the command  

  	:LocalVariablesRegisterHook EVENT
 
  Use this feature, e.g., for recompiling some files after saving.

                                                      *s:localVariablesAllowExec*
The value of s:localVariablesAllowExec (default=1) defines if the execution 
of special variables is allowed. Values: >

	0 ... disable
	1 ... query user, default = no
	2 ... query user, default = yes
	3 ... allow

NOTE: You most likely have to edit the plugin to change this variable.

NOTE: A change from 0 to [1-3] takes effect only after reloading the plugin!

NOTE: |input()| appears to make problems when opening a file - vim (6.2) 
appears to hang. When a gui is running, use |inputdialog()| for querying 
the user. I don't know if |input()| works on a terminal.

                                                      *localvariables-security-risks*
CAVEAT: Be aware that "special values" are evaluated with |execute|.  
This potentially pushes vim ahead in the era of computer viruses/worms. 
Take care.

Example:
Execute >

	LocalVariablesRegisterHook! BufWritePre
	
and put something like this at the end of a file: >

	### Local Variables: ###
	### b:variable1:1 ###
	### g:variable2:"2" ###
	### variable3:"three" ###
	### tab-width:4 ###
	### ::exec:echo "Got it!" ###
	### ::OnBufWritePre:call inputdialog("You shouldn't have written this text") ###
	### End: ###

< 
                                                      *localvariables-install*
Usage:

1. Extract the archive to your vimfiles directory. Run |helptags| on this directory.

2. Insert something like this into your .vimrc: >

	autocmd BufReadPost * call LocalVariablesCheck()
	
Or rather: >

	autocmd BufEnter    * call LocalVariablesCheck()

3. Optionally, read |localvariables-security-risks| and register some 
events as in: >

	LocalVariablesRegisterHook! BufWritePre

When calling LocalVariablesCheck(), the buffer will only be scanned once.  
Force an re-evaluation of file local variables by calling 
LocalVariablesReCheck().
