                                                    *tAssert-intro*
Introduction:
This plugin defines a command |:TAssert| that takes an expression as 
argument and throws an exception if this expression evaluates to 
|empty()|. You can insert these comments throughout your code whenever 
something potentially could go wrong in your vim scripts. The exception 
is then thrown right where to problem occurs.

To some extent you can also write some sort of primitive "unit" tests 
(ie scripts testing other scripts).

                                                    *g:TASSERT*
In order to minimize the speed penalty, these assertions are only 
evaluated when g:TASSERT is non-null. Otherwise assertions are fully 
ignored.

When changing the value of g:TASSERT, you have to reload the plugin to 
make this change effective. This is automatically done by using the 
convenience commands listed below.


Assert Commands:
                                                    *:TAssert*
    TAssert[!] {expr} ... Test that an expression doesn't evaluate to 
    something |empty()|. If used after a |:TAssertBegin| command, any 
    occurrences of "<SID>" in the expression is replaced with the 
    current script's |<SNR>|. With [!] failures are logged according to 
    the setting of |g:tAssertLog|.


Convenience Commands:
                            *:TAssertOn* *:TAssertOff* *:TAssertToggle*
    TAssertOn, TAssertOff, TAssertToggle ... Switch assertions on or off 
    and reload the plugin.

                                                    *:TAssertSource*
    TAssertSource [{file}] ... Source file (or current buffer if none 
    provided, while temporarily setting |g:TASSERT| to 1.

                                *:TAssertComment* *:TAssertUncomment*
    TAssertComment, TAssertUncomment ... (Un-)Comment TAssert* commands 
    and all lines between a TAssertBegin and a TAssertEnd command.

                                                    *:TAssertBegin*
    TAssertBegin[!] [{message}], [{script context}] ... Marks the 
    beginning of a sequence some assertions and takes an optional 
    message string as argument. The second command (a regexp) can be 
    used to evaluate functions prefixed with |<SID>| in a different 
    context.
    This command is optional. It serves primarily as marker for use with 
    the :TAssertComment command. With [!] the {message} is echoed, which 
    can be useful in unit testing kind of scripts.

                                                    *:TAssertEnd*
    TAssertEnd [{variable1} {function1()}...] ... Mark the end of a 
    sequence of assertions. Call |:unlet| for temporary variables or 
    |:delfunction| for temporary functions named on the command line.


Convenience Function:
    IsNumber(arg)
    IsString(arg)
    IsFuncref(arg)
    IsList(arg)
    IsDictionary(arg)
    IsEqual(arg1, arg2)
    IsNotEqual(arg1, arg2)
    IsMatch(arg1, arg2)
    IsException(expr)
    IsError(expr, rx)


                                                    *tAssert-logging*
Logging:
Logging is done by 00tLog.vim.
                                                    *g:tlog*
The variable g:tlog can have the following values:

    echom ... Print messages in the echo area.
    file  ... Print messages in g:tAssertLogFile
    Decho ... Print messages via Decho (vimscript#642)

This affects the commands TAssertBegin! and TAssert! with the |<bang>|.


                                                    *tAssert-examples*
Examples: >
    TAssertBegin "General"
    fun! <SID>TestFunction(a, b)
        return a:a + a:b
    endf
    TAssert 0 == 0
    TAssert "bla" == "bla"
    TAssert IsNumber(1)
    TAssert IsString("foo")
    TAssert IsFuncref(function('IsFuncref'))
    TAssert IsList([1,2,3])
    TAssert IsDictionary({1:2})
    TAssert !IsNumber("Foo")
    TAssert !IsString(1)
    TAssert !IsFuncref({1:2})
    TAssert !IsList(function('IsFuncref'))
    TAssert !IsDictionary([1,2,3])
    TAssert DoRaise('0 + [1]') =~ ':E745:'
    TAssert <SID>TestFunction(1, 2) == 3
    TAssertEnd var varl vard

    TAssertBegin "Switching context", '.\{-}/plugin/00tAssert.vim'
    TAssert <SID>Test(1) == 2
    TAssertEnd


                                                    *tAssert-install*
Install:
Save this file as plugin/00tAssert.vim (the convenience commands 
currently expect to find it there). If g:TASSERT is 0, the impact of 
this script on startup time should be minimal.


                                                    *tAssert-redistribute*
Compatibility:
If you want to redistribute files containing assertions but don't want 
to have people install this plugin, insert this close to the top of 
your file: >

    if exists(':TAssert')
        exec TAssertInit()
    else
        command! -nargs=* -bang TAssert :
        command! -nargs=* -bang TAssertBegin :
        command! -nargs=* -bang TAssertEnd :
    endif
