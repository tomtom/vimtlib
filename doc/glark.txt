Command~
This plugin provides one wrapper command for the glark command:

    :Glark <args>

The arguments are passed to the glark command.

It displays the output of the glark command (see below) in a window, 
does some highlighting and provides some handy key maps.

glark (a ruby-based, grep-like utility) was made by Jeff Pace and can be 
downloaded from:

    http://glark.sourceforge.net

Make sure your version is >= 1.7.5.
