*spec.txt*          Behaviour-driven design (BDD) for vim scripts
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

This plugin provides a small set of commands to facilitate 
behaviour-driven design of vim plugins. It basically consists of two 
parts:

    spec   ... BDD-related commands
    should ... Convenience functions for testing

According to BDD theory, you are supposed to write a specification first 
and then make the code fulfill that specification. If you don't believe 
in BDD, you could also think of spec.vim as a more convenient approach 
to unit testing.

A example specification could look like this: >

    SpecBegin 'title': 'Foo', 'sfile': 'autoload/foo.vim'

    It should add numbers.
    Should be equal foo#Add(1, 2), 3
    
    It should not add values of other types.
    Should throw something 'foo#Add("1", 2)'

Spec knows how to rewrite certain rules in order to turn them into 
proper function call. Compare the following rules: >

    Should should#throw#Something('foo#Add([1], 2)')
    Should throw#Something('foo#Add([1], 2)')
    Should throw something('foo#Add({1:2}, 2)')
    Should throw something 'foo#Add({1:2}, 2)'

    Should !should#be#Equal(foo#Add(1, 2), 3)
    Should not be equal foo#Add(1, 2), 4

Specification scripts basically are normal vim scripts but must be run 
by the |:Spec| command. The |:SpecBegin| command also allows to define 
options sets against which the specification will be tested.

For an example specification see: ../spec/spec/spec.vim

CAVEAT: Please read at least the comments on |:Spec| and |:SpecBegin|.

See :help vimball for details. If you have difficulties or use vim 7.0, 
please make sure, you have the current version of vimball
(vimscript #1502) installed or update your runtime.

Some "should"-functions require tlib (vimscript #1863) to be installed.
