*templator.txt*     Multi-file project templates using skeleton/snippets engines
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

In many programming languages/environments, you usually work with a set of files 
that belong together. E.g. if you create a c file, you usually also want to 
create a h header file. If you create a viewer file, you usually also want to 
create corresponding model and controller files. If you want to create a 
library file, you usually also want to create some test file etc. This is were 
templator comes in.

The templator plugin allows the creation of filesets based on multi-file 
templates. Possible use cases:

    - Create multi-file projects
    - Create multiple-files within a project, e.g.
        - a source file and the corresponding header file
        - a source file and the corresponding test file
        - files for a model, a view, and a controller

Templates can be written in any code template/skeleton/snippets style. At the 
time of writing, templates can be written in:

    - template vim (see |templator-tvim|) ("tvim" extension)
    - tskeleton (vimscript #1160) ("tskel" extension)

It shouldn't be too difficult to add support for additional template 
engines.

The |:Templator| command can be used to create multi-file projects.

Example 1: Create files for the "vimplugin" template-set in the current root 
directory, which usually is the current working directory unless 
|b:templator_root_dir| is set (see |templator-arguments| for details): >

    :Templator vimplugin myplugin

"myplugin" is the plugin's name. The argument is required by the 
template set used in this example. It is also possible to use named 
arguments.

Example 2: Create files for the "vimplugin" template-set in some directory (the 
directory is created if it doesn't already exist): >

    :Templator ~/src/foo/bar/vimplugin myplugin

Templates are kept in "templator" subdirectories in your 'runtimepath' (e.g. 
~/.vim/templator). A subdirectory's name consists of 
"TEMPLATE_NAME.TEMPLATE_TYPE". TEMPLATE_NAME is the name that is used for the 
|:Templator| command. TEMPLATE_TYPE is the name of the template engine used to 
expand file templates.

Templates consist of a bunch of files and an optional vim script (see 
|templator-scripts|) that is run after creating the files.

Tutorial~

Following the second example above, (using tskeleton for file templates) the 
root directory of the template set would be: >
    
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/

The template set could, e.g., consist of the following files: >

    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/README_${1}.TXT
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/docs/${1}.txt
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/plugin/${1}.vim
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/autoload/${1}.vim

and an optional vim script (see |templator-scripts|) in:
    
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.vim

This vim script is run with ~/src/foo/bar/ set as current working directory.

The above command call >

    :Templator ~/src/foo/bar/vimplugin myplugin

would the result in the creation of the following files: >

    ~/src/foo/bar/README_myplugin.TXT
    ~/src/foo/bar/docs/myplugin.txt
    ~/src/foo/bar/plugin/myplugin.vim
    ~/src/foo/bar/autoload/myplugin.vim

Any placeholders within the files are expanded.

Template scripts~

Every template set may be accompanied by a vim script in the parent directory. 
E.g. the script file for the template set "~/.vim/templator/test.tskel/" is 
"~/.vim/templator/test.vim".

The template script for template NAME can set the following 
|dictionary-function|s (self is set to g:templator#hooks[NAME]):

    g:templator#hooks.{NAME}.CheckArgs(args) dict
        Check whether the provided command-line arguments are complete 
        and fit the requirements of the template set. Return true (i.e. 
        non-zero) if the arguments are valid; otherwise return false 
        (i.e. 0). If the function returns false, an exception is 
        |:throw|n. Since "args" is a mutable dictionary, the function 
        can modify the args argument.

    g:templator#hooks.{NAME}.Before(args) dict
        Called before processing the template set.

    g:templator#hooks.{NAME}.IncludeFilename(args) dict => boolean
        Return false if the current file should not be created. Return true 
        otherwise. If the hook isn't defined, the value defaults to true.
        args['__FILE__'] contains the name of the template file.
        args['__FILENAME__'] contains the name of the filename that would be 
        created on disk.

    g:templator#hooks.{NAME}.Buffer(args) dict
        Called on each newly created file.

    g:templator#hooks.{NAME}.After(args) dict
        Called after processing the template set.

                                                    *templator-arguments*
Arguments for the |:Templator| command~

The first "name" argument to the |:Templator| command defines:

    1. where to put newly created files
    2. based on which template set.

The "name" argument consists of one to three parts: [*][DIR]NAME

    * ...... Optional: Create the files relative to a project root directory 
             (see |b:templator_root_dir|). Templator uses the following methods 
             to find the project's root directory:
                                                    *b:templator_root_dir*
                  1. If the variable b:templator_root_dir exists, use its 
                     value.
                  2. If tlib (vimscript #1863) is available, check if the 
                     current buffer is under the control of a supported VCS and 
                     use that directory.

    DIR .... Optional: A relative or absolute directory name. The directory 
             will be created if it doesn't exist. E.g. "foo/bar/test" will 
             create file from the template set "test" in the directory 
             "foo/bar", which will be created if necessary.

    NAME ... The name of the template set to be used. The NAME of the template 
             set "foo.tskel" is "foo".

Example:
If b:templator_root_dir is /home/foo/bar and the current buffer is 
/home/foo/bar/src/lib/test.c, then *boo/far will create files from the 
"far" template set in /home/foo/bar/boo.

Additional arguments can be passed as a mix of numbered and named 
arguments. E.g. "foo name=bar boo" will be parsed as:

    1    = foo
    name = bar
    2    = boo

Those arguments can be used from placeholders (see 
|templator-placeholders|).

                                                    *templator-placeholders*
Placeholders in filenames~

The basename of template files may contain place holders. The values for these 
placeholders can be set when calling the |:Templator| command.

The argument may contain named or numbered arguments. E.g.

    :Templator test foo class=Test bar

Will create files based on the template set called "test" with the following 
argument list:

    1 ....... foo
    2 ....... bar
    class ... Test

Placeholders in filenames can be defined as follows:

    ${1} .............. 1 can be any numeric value that references the nth 
                        (unnamed) value of the argument list
    ${NAME} ........... Replace with the argument NAME
    ${NAME=DEFAULT} ... Replace with the argument NAME but use the DEFAULT 
                        value if it isn't set

Example: With the above argument list the template filename "docs/${class}.txt" 
will be expanded to the filename "~/src/foo/bar/docs/Test.txt".

Optional enhancements:

In order to use tskeleton-style template sets, tskeleton (vimscript #1160) must
